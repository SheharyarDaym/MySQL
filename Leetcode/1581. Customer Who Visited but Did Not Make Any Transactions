select v.customer_id, COUNT(v.visit_id) AS count_no_trans 
from Visits as v
left join Transactions as t
on v.visit_id = t.visit_id
where t.transaction_id is null 
group by(v.customer_id);


-- Explanation of line 6: what is the working of where clause here..

-- The condition WHERE t.transaction_id IS NULL in your 
-- query is used to filter the results and return only those 
-- rows where a corresponding entry in the Transactions table 
-- does not exist for a given visit_id. This effectively finds 
-- customers who made visits but did not make any transactions.
