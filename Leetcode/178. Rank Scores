# Difficulty : Medium

select score , dense_rank() over (order by score desc) as 'rank'
from scores
order by score desc;

# rank() and dense_rank() are built-in functions in windows..
# The DENSE_RANK() function works similarly to RANK(), but it handles ties differently. 
# It assigns the same rank to rows with equal values, but the next rank is always consecutive, without gaps.
