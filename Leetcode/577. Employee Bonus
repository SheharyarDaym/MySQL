select e.name, b.bonus
from Employee as e
left join Bonus b
on e.empid = b.empid
where b.bonus < 1000 or b.bonus is null;

# Explanation:
# b.bonus < 1000: This ensures that only records with a bonus less than 1000 are selected.
# OR b.bonus IS NULL: This ensures that employees without a bonus (i.e., those with NULL in the bonus column)
# are still included in the result, as per the behavior of LEFT JOIN.
